      <h3>Aim of the Workshop</h3>

      <p>This workshop aims to foster a dialogue to explore these challenges and opportunities, discussing how to optimize the beneficial impacts of LLM-powered CUIs on health and wellbeing while effectively managing and mitigating associated risks. Participants will engage in examining themes such as privacy-centric conversational interventions, proactive and adaptive strategies and agency which are pivotal in designing CUIs that are not only effective but also ethically sound and user-friendly. These discussions will help in developing frameworks and collaborations that will guide the ethical development and practical application of CUIs in health and wellness, ensuring they enhance rather than compromise user wellbeing.
